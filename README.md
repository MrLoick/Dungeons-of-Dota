Action RPG Custom Gamemode for Dota 2

This gamemode is meant to be a timekiller with somewhat simple mechanics and engaging gameplay.

Most of the scripts are or are based off of Valve's RPG_Example and other's work, such as Arhowk.
The majority of work I have done on this project so far has been mapmaking and designing enemies using Dota assets.
My personal goal with this addon is to produce a total of 10 maps, featuring a variety of enemies, and 6 playable
heroes with abilities based on existing Dota abilities, as well as some new abilities. Overall I want to learn how
to code well and manage a project.
